# Basic Programs

A collection of basic programs from various different programming languages.

- You can contribute programs from any languages.

## Contributing Guidelines

1.  Make a folder of the language you are writing program on if it doesn't exist already.

    Example:

    ```
    JavaScript -> program.js
    Python -> program.py
    Rust -> program.rs
    PHP -> program.php
    ```

2.  Pre-existing programs can be refactored and made a pull request but if the program already exists in the repo, do not make another pull request for the same program.
3.  No spam pull requests, any spam pull requests will be marked as `Spam`.

**4) Only one PR per GitHub account.**

### That's it. Happy Contributing!
